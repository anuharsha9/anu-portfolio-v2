    Principal Product Designer, Senior Product Designer, UX Design Lead, Enterprise UX Designer, Lead Systems Designer

<!-- Career Summary -->
<h1>CAREER SUMMARY</h1>
<div class="summary">
    Principal-level Product Designer with 13 years of end-to-end experience across B2C consumer products, B2B enterprise platforms, AI/ML workflows, systems design, mobile, and web. Specialize in modernizing complex workflows, simplifying multi-step systems, and bringing clarity to ambiguous problem spaces. Operate as a UX leader: aligning engineering, data science, and product teams; driving cross-functional clarity; and mentoring designers. Work at the intersection of product strategy, systems architecture, and user-centered design, delivering scalable, high-impact experiences that make measurable business impact. Proven track record of Principal-level impact at scale—redesigning mission-critical systems serving millions of users, reducing clicks by 44-56%, and eliminating support bottlenecks.
</div>

<!-- AI-Assisted Design & Development -->
<h1>AI-ASSISTED DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<div class="summary">
    <strong>Designed and Developed Portfolio Website with AI assistance</strong>. Leverage strong foundational knowledge of HTML/CSS and AI-assisted workflows to bridge design-to-implementation, delivering production-ready front-end code. Approach: design the system first (problem framing, user flows, UX strategy), use AI to generate foundation (HTML/CSS scaffolds, React/JavaScript components, layouts), then manually audit, debug, and refine (accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS specificity, interactions). While not a deep React/JavaScript expert, effectively leverage AI to understand code, debug issues, and explore alternatives—treating AI as a managed resource where my role is architecture, direction, and quality control. Portfolio (anujaharsha.com), built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, deployed on AWS S3/CloudFront, demonstrates this capability. Source code available on GitHub.
