# Sitemap Submission Instructions

## Google Search Console Setup

### Step 1: Verify Your Website

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Enter your website URL: `https://anujaharsha.com`
4. Choose verification method:
   - **Recommended:** HTML file upload
   - **Alternative:** HTML tag (add to `<head>` in `src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - **Alternative:** DNS record (if you have access)

### Step 2: Submit Sitemap

Once verified:

1. In Google Search Console, go to **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
2. Enter sitemap URL: `https://anujaharsha.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Click **Submit**
4. Wait for Google to process (usually 1-2 days)

### Step 3: Monitor Indexing

1. Go to **Coverage** report to see indexed pages
2. Check **Performance** to see search queries
3. Review **Enhancements** for structured data issues

## Alternative: Submit via API (Automated)

If you want to automate sitemap submission, you can use the Google Search Console API:

```bash
# Install Google API client (if not already installed)
npm install googleapis

# Create a script to submit sitemap
# scripts/submit-sitemap.js
```

**Note:** API submission requires OAuth 2.0 setup and is more complex. Manual submission via the web interface is recommended for most users.

## Sitemap Location

Your sitemap is automatically generated by Next.js and located at:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml` (dev)
- **Production:** `https://anujaharsha.com/sitemap.xml`

The sitemap includes:
- Homepage (`/`)
- About page (`/me`)
- All case studies (`/work/reportcaster`, `/work/ml-functions`, `/work/iq-plugin`)
