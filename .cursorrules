## CRITICAL: Always restart dev server after code changes

The Next.js dev server can get into a bad state after code changes, especially when:
- Adding/removing components
- Changing imports
- Modifying TypeScript types
- Updating component structure

**SOLUTION: Always use `npm run dev:restart` after making code changes**

This script:
1. Stops any running dev server
2. Clears the .next cache
3. Starts a fresh dev server

## Alternative: Manual restart process

If `dev:restart` doesn't work:
1. Stop server: `pkill -f "next dev"`
2. Clear cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart: `npm run dev:clean`

## Why this happens

Next.js hot-reload can fail when:
- Component structure changes significantly
- New files are added/removed
- TypeScript compilation errors occur
- Build cache becomes stale

The `predev` hook only runs on initial `npm run dev`, not during hot-reload, so manual restarts are needed.
