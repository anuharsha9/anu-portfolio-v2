This is what the resume writer gave me as pointers to write my resume.


Resume Critique Worksheet
Refer to the below tips and your resume critique for suggestions on optimizing and tailoring your resume.
Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Software Compatibility
 Your name and contact information should not be placed in a header on page 1.
 There should be no tables or text boxes.
Resume Format & Page Length
 Ensure consistent formatting throughout your entire resume, including font, headings, job titles, and bullet points.
 The industry standard for a resume is 1 to 2 pages, focusing on your most recent and relevant experience.
Resume Hot Zone
 Include a Target Job Title, Career Summary, and Key Skills section at the top of your resume.
 Do not include an objective statement, as it’s an outdated practice and often overlooked by employers.
Content
 Focus on your achievements and what sets you apart from other candidates.
 Avoid using “responsible for” or “responsibilities include.”
 Clarify company-specific jargon and acronyms.
Tailoring & Proofreading

 Be sure to tailor your resume to match each position you are applying for.
 Review grammar, punctuation, and spelling for each tailored resume before sending it out.
Connect with your coach and access additional articles, resources, and webinars in your Randstad RiseSmart online portal for further support with your resume and career transition.
Why is this so important? ATS is a software that companies use to read, classify, score, filter, and rank resumes. Text placed in a header, table, or text box cannot be read by ATS software, impacting your score.
Remember, a resume’s goal is to get you an interview where you can go into further detail regarding your career history and value you offer potential employers.
The top third of the first page of your resume is vital to making a great first impression. These sections help your resume stand out, grab a hiring managers attention, and provide an overview of your background and capabilities.
On average, hiring managers spend 7-10 seconds reviewing a resume. Make sure your resume stands out by using strong action verbs and focusing on your accomplishments.
Tailoring not only helps when applying online, it also showcases to hiring managers how you are a fit for the role. Potential employers want to see that you have the skills, qualifications, and experience they are looking for.

TARGET JOB TITLE

Principal Product Designer, Senior Product Designer, UX Design Lead, Enterprise UX, AI/ML, Systems Design
CAREER SUMMARY

Principal-level Product Designer with 13 years of end-to-end experience across B2C consumer products, B2B enterprise platforms, AI/ML workflows, systems design, mobile, and web. Specialize in modernizing complex workflows, simplifying multi-step systems, and bringing clarity to ambiguous problem spaces. Operate as a UX leader: aligning engineering, data science, and product teams; driving cross-functional clarity; and mentoring designers. Work at the intersection of product strategy, systems architecture, and user-centered design, delivering scalable, high-impact experiences that make measurable business impact. Proven track record of Principal-level impact at scale—redesigning mission-critical systems serving millions of users, reducing clicks by 44-56%, and eliminating support bottlenecks.
AI-ASSISTED DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT

Designed and Developed my Portfolio Website with AI assistance. Leverage strong foundational knowledge of HTML/CSS and AI-assisted workflows to bridge design-to-implementation, delivering production-ready front-end code. Approach: design the system first (problem framing, user flows, UX strategy), use AI to generate foundation (HTML/CSS scaffolds, React/JavaScript components, layouts), then manually audit, debug, and refine (accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS specificity, interactions). While not a deep React/JavaScript expert, effectively leverage AI to understand code, debug issues, and explore alternatives—treating AI as a managed resource where my role is architecture, direction, and quality control. Portfolio (anujaharsha.com), built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, deployed on AWS S3/CloudFront, demonstrates this capability. Source code available on GitHub.
