      body: `Zero ML background could have been a liability — instead, it became an advantage. I enrolled in MIT's AI/ML product design certification and embedded weekly with our Principal Data Scientist.

By the time I started designing, I understood the domain deeply enough to challenge assumptions and ask the right questions.`,

      body: `Three personas. Three different needs: data scientists wanted depth and control over hyperparameters, business users wanted simplicity and guidance, analysts wanted both. The existing experience served none of them well.

After documenting every workflow and decision point, I realized: if I find this frustrating after weeks of study, a first-time user has no chance. That insight drove the redesign.`,

      summary: 'Designed a structured 4-step guided flow: Problem Type → Target → Predictors → Hyperparameters.',
      body: `The mapping revealed the problems, but solving them required multiple iterations. Three critical pivots shaped the final design.

Breakthrough: I asked our Principal Data Scientist, "What do you absolutely need to train a model responsibly?" His answer: problem type, target variable, predictors, and hyperparameters. That became the 4-step UX spine — a linear flow that made ML accessible without dumbing it down.`,

      body: `Led cross-functional alignment across Product, Engineering, and Data Science. Weekly syncs. Shared Figma. Screen-reviewed design reviews.

The confusion matrix screen alone went through 10+ iterations. Our Principal Data Scientist pushed for advanced metrics; I pushed for clarity. That productive tension produced what he called "the best screen in the entire UX revamp."

**What I'd do differently:** Earlier, cleaner alignment with our Data Scientist. He surfaced insights late in the process that were harder to incorporate — some we did, but it cost us time.`,

      body: `The dual-experience approach emerged from engineering constraints. We couldn't rebuild the advanced mode — it had to coexist with the new guided flow. What felt like a limitation became a feature: experts got their power, newcomers got guidance.

I led this while simultaneously owning ReportCaster and IQ Plugin. Cross-project pattern sharing meant solutions in one project accelerated the others.`,

The patterns I developed here — structured flows, upstream validation, right-click entry, dual-experience — became the foundation for IQ Plugin and platform-wide AI strategy.`,
