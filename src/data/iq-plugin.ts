      title: 'Discover Deeply: From Roadmap Concept to Strategic Definition',
      summary: 'Three powerful features existed — but nobody could find them. Customer feedback confirmed: visibility was the problem.',
      body: `WebFOCUS had three data science features:
• **NLQ** — Natural Language Query: ask questions against your data in plain English ("Which product sold most last quarter?")
• **Insights** — Auto-generates visualizations and patterns from your dataset
• **ML** — Train predictive models: classification, regression, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection

All shipping. None legacy. The problem? They weren't visible. NLQ was buried in Explore Data. Insights was hidden in a submenu. ML lived in a completely separate context.

**How I discovered this:** Customer feedback from support reps, PMs, and leadership all pointed to the same issue — users didn't know these features existed. The problem wasn't quality; it was discoverability.`,

      title: 'Empathize with the Ecosystem: Bridging the Gap Between Personas',
      summary: 'Data scientists needed depth. Business users needed simplicity. One entry point had to serve both.',
      body: `Two primary personas with conflicting needs:
• **Data scientists** wanted depth, control, and advanced configuration options
• **Business users** wanted simplicity, guidance, and quick answers without technical complexity

They had completely different mental models — but we needed one entry point for both. The solution was layered disclosure: approachable on the surface for business users, powerful underneath for data scientists.`,
    },
    {
      id: 'section-03',
      index: 'S',
      title: 'Simplify the Chaos: Mapping and Unifying the System',
      summary: 'Integrated three scattered entry points into the Hub. Already owned all three — integration felt natural.',
      body: `I defined the architecture before any tickets existed. The PM wrote tickets after seeing my mockups — that's how I operated throughout.

**Why integration was natural:** I already owned all three features. NLQ, Insights, and ML were mine. When the DSML Hub opportunity came, the hard work was already done — I understood every workflow, every edge case, every user pain point.

Key architectural decisions:
• Smart integration into the Hub — no extra space, everything inside
• One DSML Hub as the single entry point
• Consistent interaction patterns across NLQ, Insights, and ML
• Fully responsive — works on any screen size
• No new infrastructure; built within existing Hub ecosystem

This meant faster development and familiar patterns for engineering.`,
    },
    {
      id: 'section-04',
      index: 'I',
      title: 'Iterate with Inclusion: The Evolution of a Unified Hub',
      summary: 'Same features, transformed experience. Three separate tools became one cohesive hub.',
      body: `The transformation wasn't about changing features — it was about changing how users find and access them.

**Before:** Three separate entry points, three different mental models, three chances for users to give up.
**After:** One DSML Hub, consistent patterns, one learning curve.

Drag the sliders to see the transformation.`,

      title: 'Grow Through Constraints: Strategic Ownership at Scale',
      summary: 'Fought for features, lost some battles. Built within constraints, enabled two designers to continue.',
      body: `**What got rejected:** A lot. I fought for a navigation bar in IQ — eventually won. Built a "Get Started" panel that got scrapped after significant effort (we integrated it better elsewhere). Pushed for more IQ features on the Hub homepage — rejected due to engineering resources.

The Hub ecosystem constraint became an advantage: familiar patterns meant faster development and easier adoption. After establishing the architecture and base screens, I handed off to two designers (one junior, one senior). They executed confidently because the foundation was clear.

**What I'd do differently:** I wanted to add proper tutorials and onboarding flows — never got full green light. I envisioned NLQ as a chat interface for WebFOCUS itself (step-by-step workflow guidance), and I wanted to connect ReportCaster and IQ (schedule generated insights automatically). These remain opportunities for the platform.`,

    {
      id: 'section-06',

      title: 'Navigate Forward: Adoption, Impact, and Future',
      summary: 'NLQ adoption +25%. Insights live. DSML Hub shipping 2027.',
      body: `**What's live now (9.3.6):**
• NLQ with +25% adoption increase
• Insights with auto-generated visualizations

**What's shipping:**
• ML Functions redesign → 2026
• Unified DSML Hub → 2027

The +25% NLQ adoption increase came from making the feature discoverable — not from changing the feature itself. Visibility was the problem. Visibility was the solution.`,
