    fullQuote: `It is my pleasure to write to you in support of Anuja Harsha Nimmagadda's application for the role of Senior Product Designer at Apple.

As a Principal Data Scientist at Cloud Software Group, I have worked closely with Anuja on a number of AI/ML-driven initiatives. The clarity of her designs, in spite of the underlying data science and machine learning complexity, is impressive and has greatly contributed to the success of our products.

The key characteristic of her work is that her design solutions are rooted in a deep understanding of the purpose of the product. From that basis, she skillfully navigates the technical UI-design complexities, always leading to clean designs and to products that are a genuine joy to use.

Some of her most important contributions include:

• Redesigning ML Workflows – She led the redesign of our machine learning model training and deployment UX, significantly improving usability for both technical and non-technical users.

• Creating the IQ Feature – She played a key role in designing a centralized hub for machine learning, insight generation, and natural language querying (NLQ), ensuring AI-powered insights are intuitive and actionable.

• Improving Collaboration Between Design and Data Science – Anuja actively engaged with data scientists, engineers, and product managers, asking the right questions, identifying pain points, and ensuring AI/ML-powered features were user-friendly and seamlessly integrated into our platform.

Beyond her technical excellence, Anuja is a collaborative, thoughtful, and inspiring team member. She is fun to work with: always willing to mentor others, share her knowledge, and push the boundaries of what's possible in AI-powered UX.

Although I will be unhappy to see her go, it is the right time for her to follow her ambition, and there is no doubt in my mind that she would be an invaluable addition to your Human Interface Design team.`,

I was highly impressed with Anuja's approach. A strong UI/UX is critical for user acceptance of product features, and her design was clean, intuitive, and clearly addressed the needs of users across different skill levels. Our sessions were very productive.

Anuja has a remarkable ability to utilize practical design principles to effectively bridge the gap between core product features and an enhanced user experience. Anticipating the next move of the user, that is next level UI!`,

    name: 'Vikram Patel',

    company: '9P Studioz',
    relationship: 'Vikram was my first ever boss and my first design job, where I learned the fundamentals of design and client work.',
    category: 'origin',
    shortQuote: 'She quickly became the designer we trusted for everything. By the time she moved on, she was operating at a level far beyond her experience, ready for enterprise-grade work.',
    fullQuote: `Anuja joined us as an 18-year-old intern who had just learned Photoshop. She didn't know what 'UX' was yet — but she had intensity, discipline, and raw talent you can't teach.

We ran a scrappy, fast-paced startup. No layers, no managers. Within months, she became the designer we relied on for everything — UI, wireframes, branding, game design, motion graphics, client presentations. If it needed design, Anuja owned it.

She attended college in the mornings, came straight to the studio, and worked late nights with our engineers to ship. That wasn't asked of her — that was just who she was.

Over four and a half years, she built dozens of apps, games, and MVPs with us. She learned to collaborate with senior engineers, work directly with co-founders, handle clients, and deliver at startup speed.

By the time she left, she wasn't junior anymore. She was thinking in systems, trusted with high-stakes decisions, operating far beyond her years. 9P Studioz was her training ground — but she'd already outgrown it. She was ready for a much bigger stage.`,
